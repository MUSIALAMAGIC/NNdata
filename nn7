Speaker5 02:04
It's quite good.
Facilitator 02:08
You think it's quite good, but not when you're living at the moment, right? So mixed bag really? Because we got a not so very not bad and I don't know if I don't use them.

Speaker3 02:37
You can plan.
Facilitator(AC) 02:39
What about having somebody help you plan it if you're not really sure, but I that's a lot of Information to look up. If you look.
Speaker3 02:45
there is a helpful office where you could get Information, okay, buses.
Facilitator(AC) 02:52
what about Information from the council and all and the support you get from council? Does it need revising and improving or is it? Okay?
Speaker4 03:01
I don't think it's okay so okay far.

No about what I think. It's all right.
Speaker5 03:06
I don't know. Why have you got cheese that's not wrapped?
Speaker4 03:12

Speaker5 03:17
Your preferential we。
Speaker3 03:20

Speaker4 03:24
In all we caught not living here.
Facilitator 03:26
I like that all in all we quite like living, yes.
Speaker4 03:30
Nice, that's intend to move less ones got no.
Facilitator(AC) 03:34
I I think that's all we have really okay, I guess, the only little, tiny question I would like to throw in as an extra

Are you aware of any particular problems that climate change is going to bring to? Norfolk?
Facilitator 03:52
Climate change is gonna bring。
Facilitator(AC) 03:55
to Norfolk?
Facilitator 03:58
No, the Coach services, the coaches, it probably would have anyway, but it's gonna speed it up you know. Yeah, it's gonna speed it up. So the coastal erosion accelerated acceleration.
Facilitator(AC) 04:14
Anything else besides that rope that you can think of for climate change?
Speaker3 04:20
People are having to move off the place
Speaker4 04:22
Man I don't know. Is it gonna really heat up? Is that gonna cause problems?
Facilitator(AC) 04:27
It probably this week is pretty hot.
Speaker4 04:29
isn't it gonna be tomorrow apparently?
Speaker5 04:32
Yeah, it was on Friday. It's gonna be out tomorrow. Yeah.
Facilitator 04:38
Do you think so getting too hot might become a problem?
Speaker4 04:41
It could do you see then it will melt the glaciers and then the sea level, right?
Speaker5 04:45
That's what's gonna act anywhere, right?
Facilitator 04:47
Then i'll be flooding in some places probably not right here. No.
Speaker4 04:52
the coastal towns will start disappear and。
Speaker5 04:59
all right, mar. Great. We've already got off the coast. There's already a town that we lost。
Speaker4 05:10
going back several years. Yeah, but 50, 60 yards out.
Facilitator 05:15
The Hayes for us just been told every day that close to the ocean, sorry, not flooding.
Speaker4 05:20
close to erosion? Okay.
Facilitator(AC) 05:24
So is there much that can be done about this? Do we need more infrastructure for that? Or we below counted much about it? Right? There we are.
Speaker5 05:33
What the same will everybody wants, and there's nothing you can do that, right? Right?
Facilitator 05:38
Then so the hot weather we probably could have done more about, but might be getting late for that. I don't know.
Speaker4 05:43
Behave the Dutch deal with it because you see a lot of their countries have been seaevel altogether. That's true.
Facilitator 05:52
It's like the same。
Speaker5 05:53
is below。
Facilitator 05:54
where Clinton is. I see that the strained by the Dutch.
Speaker5 06:00
Yes, 17 something.
Facilitator 06:03

It is both that love you to none of your children been worrying too much about climate change and how it's gonna affect them. No, I can't do it. It's very tough. Yeah.
Speaker4 06:31
He says tear here you have a ring, there you。
Speaker5 06:35
go down. Well done.
Facilitator 06:39
Thank you very much and I didn't go to Wales for 6 years either that must have been quite as something. Quite something to have 6 years in Wales. Did you go home in between? No, my goodness.
Speaker5 06:53
My husband, would you say your mother's try get ready?
Facilitator(AC) 07:00
That must make you have Welsh, but I bet you won't want to admit to that.
Speaker5 07:03
I they say, if I went back to Wales, now, some of it would come back, so whether it would or not, I don't know.

Remarkable my dad's off not as the scope was back to. So it's got to find.
Facilitator(AC) 07:26
That's it really. I don't know how you feel that went. Was there any interest to you?
Speaker4 07:31
How much some help to you?
Facilitator(AC) 07:34

Speaker5 07:38

Facilitator(AC) 07:40
We're at Brighton, but we're studying more come because their coastal community, that's right. This North coast and Southampton. Yeah, that you might think Southampton is not. But did you know the people of Southampton can't get to the sea? It's all owned by it's privately owned. They can get to the ocean.
Speaker4 08:01
That's right by the port polls, artist, yeah um.
Facilitator(AC) 08:06
So we're looking at three areas and getting the different mix of problems and then where there will be some feasibility studies done to have a quick look at it and then some recommendations to government.

Probably when that's done, we'll come back with the suggestions and do something similar to this and ask people what they think.

If they all say like this and we'll take that much all, right? Yeah. I'm hoping you won't be here for that. That will be about a year and a half away, so you better not be here.
Speaker4 08:40
Hopefully, right?
Facilitator(AC) 08:42
